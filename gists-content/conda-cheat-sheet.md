Conda is a data science package and environment management application. It primarily manages Python packages but also supports R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and Fortran packages

**Choose based on your** [experience.](https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/) I have followed [Conda's tip](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html): ***"If you are just starting out, we recommend installing Conda via the Miniconda installer."*** 

I'm currently taking a AI/ML bootcamp so I'm still a 🥖 bun in the oven 😅. 

[Download the latest](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) Miniconda installer for macOS with Apple Silicon.
After the installation is finished, open your terminal and type the command  `conda`. You will see `(base)` in your terminal, which is the default environment. 

🔔 Tip

It's a good idea to have jupyter installed there.  
`(base) ➜  ~ conda install -y jupyter`

## Basic commands

**To create an environment, use:**
`conda create -n ENV_NAME`

**To activate this environment, use:** `conda activate ENV_NAME`

**To deactivate an active environment, use:**`conda deactivate`

**To remove an environment, deactivate it first and then use:** 
`conda remove --name ENV_NAME --all`

**To install packages, use:** `conda install <package>`

We can create and enviroment and install packages in one like
`conda create -n myenv python numpy pandas`

**To list packages installed in an environment:** `conda list -n ENV_NAME`

**To list all your environments:** `conda env list`

Popular packages needed :

`conda install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

To install packages located in another channel:

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

`conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn`

To update conda to the latest version:
`conda update conda`

## 🔔 Tip

Everytime you open a new tab in your terminal, it will open with the `(base)` environment by default. If you don't want this to happen.

In the file `.condarc` add

```yaml
channels:
  - defaults
auto_activate_base: false

```
