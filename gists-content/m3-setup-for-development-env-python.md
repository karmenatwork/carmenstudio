I\'currently taking a AI/ML course so my choice for working with python is Conda. However, I\'m used to `pyenv` so I wanted to try if my previous setup notes on a Intel MacBook were still valid.

macOS used to come with Python 2.7 pre-installed between versions 10.8 and 12.3. It doesn't anymore. 
However, If you've installed Xcode or its Command Line Tools you have `Python 3.9.x` installed. 
Apple's developer tools come with their own Python distribution.

**Command lines to verify if Python is installed**

| Command                                       | Description                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `which python3`                               | To check location             |
| `python3 --version`                           | To check Python\'s version    |
| `python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)"`  | To check where this Python is installed |

It would display something like:
<Image src={whichPython} alt="" /> 

**Double checking:** `Python3.framework` should be listed as part of the Apple Command Line Tools `ls -l  $(xcode-select --print-path)/Library/Frameworks`

Removing the Python installed with XCode CLT is not a good idea. Instead, install a newer version of Python with Homebrew.

```
brew install python3
```

Yet,⚠️ the Homebrew Python documentation recommends [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python environments.
As a RoR developer, `pyenv` used to be my first option on my previous Intel Macbook pro, as it was forked from `rbenv` and `ruby-build`, and modified it for python. 
I use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) now. 

**Here are my notes from before:**

- To make pyenv work, install build dependencies through Homebrew. Open Terminal, then type in:

```
brew install openssl readline xz zlib
....
....
brew install pyenv
```
You should see `.pyenv/` in your home directory.  After checking, add it to your `zsh`shell 

```blockquote
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
Now, it's ready to be used! 
```
pyenv install 3.10
....
....
pyenv global 3.10
````
***Note:*** There are [three options](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-shell) to select a Pyenv-installed Python as the version to use:

| Command                                       | Description                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `pyenv shell <version>`                       | Select just for the current shell session |
| `pyenv local <version>`                       | Automatically select whenever you are in the current directory   |
| `pyenv global <version>`                      | Select globably for your user |

⚠️ One thing to keep ALWAYS in mind is  to install ARM64 versions of these packages when available for optimal performance on your M3 chip.
